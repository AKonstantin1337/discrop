<p><!-- NOT MEANT TO BE READ DIRECTLY! This is the tooltip help for the script’s UI. -->
  This script automatically maps Discord video calls into the scene’s layout.</p>
<h3>Discord instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In the voice channel where the call is happening, go to the bottom-right corner and select <em>Pop Out.</em></li>
  <li>In the top-right corner, ensure you’re in <em>Grid</em> mode (no caller appears big while the rest are small).</li>
  <li>There too, under the three dots button, ensure <em>Show Non-Video Participants</em> is <strong>on.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>OBS capture source and scene set up</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a capture source and call it <em>{SOURCE_NAME};</em> set that source to capture your Discord call. <strong>This script will only work on a source exactly named <em>{SOURCE_NAME}.</em></strong></li>
  <li>Make sure <em>Capture Cursor</em> is <strong>off</strong> and <em>Client Area</em> is <strong>on.</strong></li>
  <li>Move it and crop it until it’s the size and position you want a single caller’s video to be in the scene— don’t pay any attention to which area of the Discord call it shows, as that’s what this script does for you.</li>
  <li>Duplicate it <strong>(always as reference)</strong> and tweak it for every other caller, across scenes, etc.</li>
  <li>Make sure the order of all <em>{SOURCE_NAME}</em> items in the <em>Sources</em> panel matches across your scenes, with the order in which you want the participants to show up (see next section).</li>
</ol>

<h3>This script set up</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Fill the text fields with the Discord server nicknames of <strong>each and every person/bot</strong> who might join the call throughout the stream, <strong>even if they aren’t online yet.</strong> Follow the same order you used on your <em>{SOURCE_NAME}</em> items in the <em>Sources</em> panel. Slots beyond the number of <em>{SOURCE_NAME}</em> items are useful for people/bots you don’t want to visually appear in the stream (e.g. <em>Groovy).</em></li>
  <li>Change the levers/numbers right below each of the names to represent their status on the Discord call: left/0 meaning offline, middle/1 online but without video, and right/2 online with video.</li>
  <li>Now it’s just a matter of keeping an eye on who drops/rejoins or toggles their webcams, and pulling the levers accordingly as fast as possible!</li>
</ol>
